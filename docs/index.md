# Docker for AI in Science

Welcome to the material for Docker in AI for Science!

In this workshop, we will introduce Docker and how it can be used to accelerate your scientific research. We will cover the basics of Docker, how to create your own Docker images, and how to use Docker to run your code in a reproducible way.

The workshop is divided into the following sections:

## Understanding Docker

### What is it?
- Key concepts:
    - Images
    - Containers
    - Registries

- Containers vs VMs

### Why it matters?
- Research benefits
    - Reproducibility
    - Portability
    - Scalability

- Industry connection
    - Need for data scientists
    - Cloud deployment
    - Skills for the future

## Hands on

### Getting started
- Working with basic images
- Working with scientific images
- Managing data volumes

### Building your own images
