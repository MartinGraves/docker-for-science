# The basics of Docker

Here we will get up and running with Docker, and introduce some basic commands.

You can install Docker from the [official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Your experience may vary depending on your operating system. Take careful note of the requirements, especially for Windows - you will need the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) enabled, which should come on Windows 10 and later.
